## LAB4

Task 1:

This task was about transforming from one list to another, from the source to the target.

as shown in the image below first, we created the chosen system, EMF Ecore model (Basic library management system).

And then, as shown below, we have created another library EMF Ecore system model.

we create a new ATL file to put the code into. 
here we have written the OCL Helper definition for the library management system

The task required two ATL rules which were created in the image below

After doing the above the transformation was ready to be used with the model file as seen below the ATL Module transformation model

then after running the transformation, a file generated "libraryms.xml" as seen below

TASK 2:


i have started by installing the plugins of Acceleo and followed the steps of the tutorial. i understood the concepts of this lab which was about creating an acceleo module that generates java beans from a UML model. but because of the lack of time to research and to solve the errors i could not finish it and stopped while doing it. below is some screenshots of the things i have done.
